Render Context
**************

Render APIs use a context object that combines objects of the render
pipeline. A render context is btained from a :any:`mge::window`, and
has a 1:1 relationship with the window.

Context objects are created based upon a render context. Their life time
is bound to the render context, and they are valid for one render context
only.

.. doxygenclass:: mge::context_object

Each render context has a swap chain, a series of buffers to stabilize frame
rates and enable presenting frames.

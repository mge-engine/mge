Why MGE?
========

There exist likely already too many game and graphics engines,
so why create another one? First, of course, for pure personal
enjoyment and education.

MGE stands for *Modern Game Engine*. It is modern because we
use C++20, and follow the modern concepts of the programmable
graphics pipeline.

MGE makes use of STL and Boost, which are not always used
(for various reasons) in game development. MGE makes heavy
use of these, but uses own data structures where these are
appropriate or needed.

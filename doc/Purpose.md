# Why MGE?

MGE is not created to be competition to well-known big game engines, like _Unreal Engine_ or _Unity_, but to explore a more programmer-centric approach, putting focus on

* procedural content generation,,
* a strong asset management pipeline
* design to be expandable by plugins and scripts,
* use features available in modern C++
* abstract and encapsulate graphics APIs

# Why MGE?

MGE is not created to be competition to well-known big game engines, like _Unreal Engine_ _Godot_, or _Unity_, but to explore a more programmer-centric approach, putting focus on

* procedural content generation,,
* a strong asset management pipeline
* design to be expandable by plugins and scripts,
* use features available in modern C++
* abstract and encapsulate graphics APIs

Yes, there exist already a lot of big engines, both commercial and open source, and creating a new one seems moot. But these engines focus on producing content within a setting of a larger team. MGE is created trying to find the answer, whether complex environments can be created with a small number of individuals.

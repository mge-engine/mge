Mathematics Library
*******************

The mathematics library provides basic mathematics as commonly used in graphics
programming. It is based on the `OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) <https://github.com/g-truc/glm>`_
library. For ease of use, the GLM library symbols are mapped into the `mge` namespace.
